In this folder, you will find 3 files: a `data.csv` file that contains a mock dataset of sales data corresponding to TV, Radio, and Newspaper ad spending. `single_attribute_regression.py` implements a linear regression model just accounting for TV spending. `full_regression.py` implements a regression model considering 
all attributes (TV, Radio, and Newspaper).
